    <h1>History of the Club</h1>
    <img src=eskimo-club.jpg> 

    <p><strong>In the early 30s,</strong> Frank Bulkley, a Colorado ski industry pioneer, took up the infant sport of skiing when one arose at 2 am to drive to the mountain, hike to the base and ski down. As he said “If you had enough nerve, you pointed your skis straight downhill. If you had enough sense, you figured out how to turn”.</p>

     <p><strong>Frank was sold on the sport of skiing</strong> and proceeded to sign up most of  Kent School  to learn to ski with him and his brothers (he was the eldest of seven children), teaching them at  Berthoud Pass. He chartered a bus for the trips up to Berthoud, which was soon referred to as the “Ski Bus.”  Students from other schools soon joined the group.</p>

     <p><strong>In the middle 30’s,</strong> George Cranmer, the farsighted Manager of Denver Parks and Improvements, had Bob Balch and Frank evaluate the terrain of what is now Winter Park and they reported that it was ideal for a ski area. So began Cranmer's incredible & successful effort to create a winter park for Denver. Subsequently, funds were raised to clear slopes and install a T-Bar tow on the lower slopes.</p> 

   <p><strong>Frank Bulkley was one of the numerous Arlberg Club members</strong> volunteering on weekends to clear ski trails for the soon to be Winter Park area, though he said they could scarcely compete with the crew of 30 burly Swedes "with arms 18 inches around”  that George Cranmer rounded up to expedite the work.</p>

    <p><strong>By 1939-40, Winter Park was fully operational.</strong>  George Cranmer contracted Frank on a handshake to run the WP Ski School and the WP Ski Shop. Soon after the area opened, Frank was bringing Denver children up via the Denver & Salt Lake Railroad to Winter Park to learn to ski. Though passengers stepped off the train covered with soot, the coal-powered steam engine was a very reliable form of transportation. The D&SL made Frank their Winter Sports Promotion Agent and by the time WWII began, there were around 350-400 members of Bulkley’s children's ski group riding the train on Saturdays and purchasing lift tickets to Winter Park.</p>   

   <p><strong>When WWII came along,</strong> Frank was assigned to what was to become the Tenth Mountain Division and taught skiing and rock climbing until sent to Officer’s Candidate School where he went on to Europe to become a company commander with the 42nd Infantry Division. He was seriously injured and taken out of action in March of 1945.</p>

   <p><strong>The war had put a stop to the Club</strong> until Bulkley returned to Winter Park in 1945-1946 to run the now named Eskimo Club on weekend leave from Fitzsimmons Hospital.  That was the year the D &SL trains were sold to the Denver & Rio Grande. Desperately needing the train to operate on Saturday for his many young skiers, Frank wrote an 8-page letter to the D&RG full of suggestions on how to run a ski train and offered to underwrite it on Saturdays. After some deliberation, the D&RG agreed to run on Saturdays again and incorporated Bulkley’s ideas.  The now named Eskimo Ski Club was up and running and Bulkley rode the ski train train every Saturday with hundreds of young skiers for the next 26 years, missing only one day in 1949 to marry Nancy Van Stone.</p> 

    <p><strong>Bulkley & Gordy Wren</strong> had teamed up to form Colorado Outings to operate both the WP Ski School and the WP Ski Shop.  Frank spent his weekdays in Denver organizing the Eskimo Club, drumming up business and operating his Eskimo Ski Shop, an outgrowth of the Club and the first ski shop in the nation to introduce season rentals.</p>

      <p><strong>Gordy left to train for the U.S. Olympic team</strong> and Bulkley eventually sold the Winter Park Shop & Ski School in the late 1960's while continuing to run the Eskimo Ski Club & his four Eskimo Ski Shops in Denver.  As well as making Winter Park the “home away from home” for many Denverites who grew up and return with their families, the Eskimo Ski Club brought a reliable source of income to WP during its struggling early years.  “We would have had a hard time meeting payroll without that train full of Eskimos on Saturdays“ reports a long-time WP employee of that era.</p>

     <p><strong>For his success in introducing thousands</strong> of children to the sport of skiing, Bulkley was inducted into the Colorado Ski Hall of Fame in 1978, “the first living inductee” he would say with a chuckle. Colorado Ski Country also honored him with the President’s Award in 1996 for a lifetime of service and dedication to the ski industry. The Eskimo Express lift at Winter Park was named in honor of his Eskimo Ski Club.</p>

   <p><strong>Tom Branch, an Eskimo Club ski instructor</strong> and United pilot and trainer as well as long time friend of Bulkley's, worked with Frank as the next Eskimo Club director and was also inducted into the Colorado Ski Hall of Fame. As Denver grew and the cross-country buses became more reliable, Bulkley began using the buses to transport the Eskimo Club members directly to the ski area, which we continue to do to this day.</p>
