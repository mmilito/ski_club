# ski_club

This repository represents both midterm and final projects while at RefactorU.  

Final project focuses on two specific issues for the Eskimo Club. Number 1 is relatively straightforward ... to make sure the bus schedule is easily found from the main page and is clean and easy to read. (Unlike today, where the information is buried and involves multiple clicks plus scrolling.)

Second objective is to allow the administrator to 1) find a kid easily, 2) be offered the correct class list based on kid's age and 3) update ski or snowboard level without any additional clicks to select or save.  Design was requested to be clean and simple.

In total, the final project represents about 10 days work and my first outing with Angular.js.

Midterm is in a separate folder (named midterm) and just addresses objective number 2. It was done with JQuery and DOM traversal, etc. and no persisting through to a database. This represents about 5 days work.

Let me know if you're interested in seeing more and I can show off the Heroku site ... :)
